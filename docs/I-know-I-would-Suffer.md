#  I know I would suffer

    If I had loved you less or played you slyly,
    I might have pleased you a bit more,
    But at the cost of words I value highly,
    And with no such feeling as the one before.

    Should I remember only your eyes, your smile,
    and times when I felt you but only mine,
    though such memories are scattered and few,
    I shall have only good to say of you.

    There is a name I dare not speak again,
    A face I never again must call to mind;
    I know I would suffer if I think of you.
